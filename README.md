## Summary

I designed a new product card that is being used in product listing page. As indicated in the test description, it includes:

- Product image
- Product name
- A dropdown or label for variant options
- An “Add to Cart” button
- Disabled or replaced with “Out of Stock” if the product is unavailable
- A clean and modern visual layout, following UI/UX best practices

I chose to keep the same grid layout as this is quite common in PLPs and otherwise wasn't asked. Just polished the product cards, added small, minimalistic animation and shadow plays to make it more engaging. It is fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
